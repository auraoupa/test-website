This international Workshop will take place in Grenoble on **20-21 April 2017**.

We will discuss the origin and structure of the *ocean’s Chaotic Intrinsic Variability* that emerges in the turbulent regime, and impacts most oceanic fields over a wide range of space and time scales. 

We will also address the atmospheric modulation and possible climate impacts of this oceanic “chaos”, the modelling strategies and new diagnostic approaches required to address these questions.

More details are provided on the [workshop website](https://chaoticocean17.sciencesconf.org/).

 - **Contact**: Thierry Penduff

 - **Dates**: 20-21 April 2017

 - **Venue**: IGE, salle Lliboutry, 54 rue Molière, Grenoble-Alpes University Campus.
