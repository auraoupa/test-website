Ocean dynamics is described by non-linear equations, which connect the 
evolution of oceanic state variables (velocity, temperature, salinity, 
etc). Some theories predict that because of nonlinearity, the ocean 
evolution is not totally determined by external drivers such as the 
atmospheric variability: MEOM's high-resolution simulations confirm that 
the ocean evolution also depends substantially on small uncertainties in 
initial conditions, even over long (decadal and longer) periods. The 
ocean evolution is thus not fully deterministic in the turbulent regime, but partly chaotic over a wide range of timescales: it 
should be simulated from ensembles of multiple realizations, described 
and studied from probability distribution functions that represent this 
inherent uncertainty.

The ocean models are also uncertain by construction due to e.g. 
unresolved (e.g. subgrid-scale) processes, or to the unperfect 
representation of the real dynamics. The MEOM team is working on methods 
to explicitly include these modelling uncertainties into ocean 
simulations by adding stochastic parameterizations : ensembles of such 
simulations represent the range of possible oceanic evolutions given 
these uncertainties. They may then be consistently corrected through 
data assimilation techniques to better match the observations and 
provide fully probabilistic forecasts.

MEOM research aims to design ensemble and stochastically-perturbed 
simulations, for characterizing, studying and reducing these 
uncertainties. Current projects include in particular:

   - the [OCCIPUT](add link here) project, which investigates the 
climate-related fingerprints and implications of the ocean's chaotic behavior

  - our studies of modelling uncertainties, in order to improve 
operational oceanic forecasting systems (eg. at Mercator-Oc√©an).
